	//	All rank names are written in the file (addons/sourcemod/translations/lr_core_ranks.phrases.txt) - there you can change the rank names
	//	The header of the rank block is responsible for the translation phrase to be used from (lr_core_ranks.phrases.txt)
	//	If you want to enter your ranks, create a block here and create a block in ( lr_core_ranks.phrases.txt ) (the block header must match the block header in the translation file)
	//
	//	If you are going to enter your experience scores for the ranks from lr_type_statistics 1 and 2, please note. These modes have a starting value of 1000.
	//	Given that they have a starting value of 1000, it is highly recommended that you set the rank (block) to the value that is in the middle of the others.
	//	Among the standard 18 ranks, the middle one is considered to be 9, and it is in the rank_9 block that the value of 1000 is specified.
	//
	//  The settings you have changed here can be updated on the server with the console command (sm_lvl_reload) or from the Administrator Panel in the plugin menu without rebooting the server.
